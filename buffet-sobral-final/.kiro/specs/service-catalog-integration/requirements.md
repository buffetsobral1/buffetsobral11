# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the critical synchronization issue between the admin panel service management and the main page service catalog. Currently, services added through the admin interface are stored in localStorage/Supabase but do not appear in the main page catalog, which displays hardcoded services. This integration will create a unified service management system where services managed in the admin panel automatically appear in the main page catalog.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want services I add through the admin panel to automatically appear in the main page catalog, so that customers can see and request quotes for all available services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator adds a new service through the admin panel THEN the service SHALL appear in the main page catalog immediately
2. WHEN an administrator updates a service through the admin panel THEN the changes SHALL be reflected in the main page catalog
3. WHEN an administrator deletes a service through the admin panel THEN the service SHALL be removed from the main page catalog
4. WHEN the main page loads THEN it SHALL display all services from the centralized data source instead of hardcoded HTML

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a customer visiting the main page, I want to see all currently available services in the catalog, so that I can request quotes for any service the business offers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a customer visits the main page THEN the system SHALL load and display all active services from the data source
2. WHEN no services are available THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message
3. WHEN services fail to load THEN the system SHALL display a fallback message and retry loading
4. WHEN a customer clicks on a service THEN the quote request functionality SHALL work correctly with the dynamically loaded service data

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the service catalog to work both online and offline, so that the website remains functional even with connectivity issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is online THEN it SHALL load services from Supabase and cache them locally
2. WHEN the system is offline THEN it SHALL display services from the local cache
3. WHEN the system comes back online THEN it SHALL sync any changes and update the cache
4. WHEN there are conflicts between local and remote data THEN the system SHALL resolve them using the established conflict resolution strategy

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the service catalog integration to be backward compatible, so that existing functionality continues to work during and after the migration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the new system is deployed THEN existing hardcoded services SHALL be migrated to the data source
2. WHEN the migration occurs THEN no existing services SHALL be lost
3. WHEN the system encounters legacy data THEN it SHALL handle it gracefully without errors
4. WHEN the integration is complete THEN the hardcoded service HTML SHALL be removed and replaced with dynamic loading

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want service changes to be reflected immediately across all parts of the system, so that there's no confusion about available services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a service is modified in the admin panel THEN the main page SHALL reflect the changes within 5 seconds
2. WHEN multiple browser tabs are open THEN all tabs SHALL show consistent service information
3. WHEN the system detects a service data change THEN it SHALL notify all active sessions
4. WHEN there are pending changes in offline mode THEN they SHALL be synchronized when connectivity is restored
